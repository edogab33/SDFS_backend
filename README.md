# SDFS_backend

This is the API service I created for the project Satellite Driven Fire simulator: http://mclab.di.uniroma1.it/site/index.php/projects/60-sdfs-por-fesr-2014-2020-aerospazio-e-sicurezza

The database is private, so this repository serves only as a demostration.

Frontend: https://github.com/edogab33/SDFS_frontend
